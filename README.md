## Overview
I used only CSS Grid for this webpage. I believe, I could have used flexbox for the elements inside each card and made the flow row instead of the default of coloumn. That might have helped align all the content. There are two major problems I haven't been able to workout. 
1. The Qoutation Marks - I gave them position: absolute, so that it is not a part of the normal flow of the grids and document, but now, I am absolutely lost and am unable to place it where it should. Need your help here.
2. The light blue margin around the testimonial section. I am currently using a padding attribute for the body tag to get the spacing, but I am sure a better method exists.
